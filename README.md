# VBA-Projects
A repo containing different VBA projects I've worked on or am currently working on. This uses the [XVBA - Live Server VBA](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=local-smart.excel-live-server) extension for Visual Studio Code

## To run/use XVBA
1. Add extension to VSC.
2. Open a project folder with VSC (`GetHoursByProject` for example).
3. Have a index.xlsb file (The name of this file can be changed in `config.json` but having it be the default keeps things easy to track).
4. In the `Explorer` window in VSC you'll now have a `XVBA - MACRO LIST` menu.
5. Hover over it and click `Export VBA`.
6. If you want live changes then click `Start XVBA Live Server`.

If you want to add XVBA to a new project open the new project in VSC and click `Bootstrap XVBA Config` on the `XVBA - MACRO LIST` menu.
